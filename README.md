# Linear_Regression
Implement Linear_Regression class, retrieve [HousingData.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUn2WKkKeRXwH02K9bqH98KjPxrUmgXh/view) and train our model so as to predict Median House Value!

During training we have been experimented with:
1. Batch Gradient Descent
2. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
3. Stohastic Gradient Descent

You can check this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/stochastic-batch-and-mini-batch-gradient-descent-demystified-8b28978f7f5) from towardsdatascience's site, where it breaks down thoroughly the three basic types of gradient descent algorithm!
